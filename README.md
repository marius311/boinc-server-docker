boinc-server-docker
===================

`boinc-server-docker` is the easiest way to run your own [BOINC](http://boinc.berkeley.edu/) server. You can run the server on a Linux machine, in which case the requirements are, 

* [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker/releases) (>=1.10)
* [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) (>=1.6.0)
* git 

or you can run it on Windows 7+ or Mac OSX in which case you will need, 

* [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox)  (>=1.10)

There are no other dependencies, as everything else is packaged inside of Docker. 

Documentation
-------------

For a full tutorial on setting up the server, see the [project cookbook](https://github.com/marius311/boinc-server-docker/blob/master/docs/cookbook.md). 

If you are somewhat familiar with Docker and BOINC, the following short description takes you through creating a server and running your own science application. 

To check out the repository and get a test server fully up and running, simply run,
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/marius311/boinc-server-docker.git
cd boinc-server-docker
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

Next you will need to point the server url, which is by default `www.boincserver.com`, to your local host IP. This can achieved by adding the line `127.0.0.1 www.boincserver.com` to your `/etc/hosts` file. At this point you can connect a web browser or BOINC client to `www.boincserver.com/boincserver` to see the server web page or run jobs. 

*Windows/Mac:* Instead of `127.0.0.1`, use the IP address reported by the Docker Quickstart Terminal on startup. Additionally, on Windows the file is located at `C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`. 

The server comes pre-configured to immediately run Docker-based science applications. To do so, first create a Docker container which runs your code. As an example, we will use an unmodified `python:alpine` image. Suppose your calculation is run with the following command,

```bash
docker run python:alpine python -c "print('Hello BOINC')"
```

To submit a job on the server which runs this as a BOINC job you would first get a shell inside the server,

```bash
docker exec -it boincserverdocker_apache_1 bash
```

Then submit the job by running 

```bash
bin/boinc2docker_create_work.py python:alpine python -c "print('Hello BOINC')"
```

If your job has output files, have the container write them in `/root/shared/results` and they are automatically returned to the server when the job is done. 

This is a simple example, but any Docker containers with arbitrary code installed inside of them will work! 

Finally, `boinc-server-docker` is not just useful to get a simple test server running, its actually meant to run your real server. To learn how to, read the [project cookbook](https://github.com/marius311/boinc-server-docker/blob/master/docs/cookbook.md), or look at the [Cosmology@Home](https://www.github.com/marius311/cosmohome) source code as an example (`boinc-server-docker` was in fact originally developed for Cosmology@Home). 

Happy crunching! 

Developement and Contributing
-----------------------------

To modify and rebuild any of the `boinc-server-docker` images, you will need this git repository's submodules checked out (run `git submodule update --init --recursive`, or clone with `git clone --recursive` in the first place). Note also that currently building the images only works on Linux.
